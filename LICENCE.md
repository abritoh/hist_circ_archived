# GD HIST. CIRC. ARCHIVED

## Summary

This repository archives some of the **Python data-processing-scripts** as they were developed during my time as a contractor for INEEL (https://www.gob.mx/ineel) between 2017 and 2019.

The development of these scripts was part of a government project for the **National Commission of Electricity** (CFE) and the **National Center for Energy Control** (CENACE).

> The publisher/author participated in creating the codebase and implementing the web application (using C# and ASP.Net Framework 4.6) for interconnection requests, which is part of CFE's set of applications, as well as in the implementation of Python data processing scripts.

The web-application can be accessed at: https://app.cfe.mx/Aplicaciones/GeneracionDistribuida.

## Ownership and Copyright

- **Ownership**: The design, logos, images, and business requirements are the property of [CFE] and [CENACE].
- **Authors/Publisher**: These scripts were developed by [*ClusterBR (arcebrito@gmail.com)*], under INEEL specifications.

## Terms and Conditions

- These scripts are published to provide guidance on the Python programming language and to offer visibility into the author's work.

- **No Sensitive Data**: These scripts do not display any sensitive data or internal algorithms. In most cases, these python-scripts process data from historical power energy databases to generate excel files containing prognostics about power demand in the coming years, which help predict and determine the energy needs and supplies.

## Final Remarks

**Disclaimer**: This is an ARCHIVED minimal version, and no further commits will be made.
